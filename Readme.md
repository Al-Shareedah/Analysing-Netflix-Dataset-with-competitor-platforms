Netflix is one of the largest media company's today as well as an innovator in streaming technology. The current market, however, is saturated with multiple competitors who are competing on the same demographic. In this analysis, we investigated how Netflix and its competitor appeal to certain groups of people as well as different age groups. 
We used Netflix movies and Tv shows datasets from Kaggle in addition to Disney+, Hulu, and amazon prime datasets. The results showcase the content growth of each platform as well as the effect of COVID-19 pandemic with an exception to Amazon, possibly due to their immense profit from other online businesses. The audience that Netflix appeal to the most is young adults with predominantly mature adults-only content, while its direct competitor Amazon prime use a more even approach to its diverse content. Hulu and Disney+ appeal to a specific audience rather than building a massive catalog for all demographics.
